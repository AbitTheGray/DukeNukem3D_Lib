# DukeNukem 3D - C# Library

This project is C# library for loading files from [DukeNukem 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_3D).

## Usage

Important are `DukeNukem3D.Grp.Grp.Parse()` and `DukeNukem3D.Art.ArtFile.Parse()`.

The library was made using `.NET 4.5` with `System` and `System.Drawing` as assemblies.

How to use this library can be found in [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

## History

This project started at about same time as [BspLib](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/BspLib) to learn how Game Engines worked in its first days.

## Future

I am still planning to use this library to make OpenGL-based game engine (at least core of it) to visualize those retrieved data.
